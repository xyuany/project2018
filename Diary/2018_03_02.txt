Aim:
1. finish a program that can achieve input and output a query sequences.
	Questions: 1. input format should be same as model.(same encoding ways, same window size). But my old code can only do with topology information(only for testing data). For input sequence only, I have to re-write every functions. 
				2. how to save and load a model
				3. convert predict format into human-read topology information
				

Outcome:
1. To make my code more reusable. Sliding window part, I splite into two functions: seqence and topology. With the help of sorted ID_list, sequence and topology can corresponds to each other.
	I verify it by running old code and new code with same input, write output in different files, and compare them. there is no difference between them. So re-writing is successful.
	I found some shortages in my old code, by updating it. I randomly used seq varible and topo varible in one function, though lots of them have same value. That leads to bugs in my testing.

2. run my whole dataset and save it
