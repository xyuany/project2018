Aim:
1. READ Sklearn instructions and write output.(morning)
   http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html
2. READ why one-hot encode data in machine learning.
   https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/
3. Read how to do machine learning by python if still have time.(morning)
   https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
4. write project plan(afternoon)
5. journal club preparation(evening)

Outcome:
1. a. totally don't understand. 
   b. convert attributes to 1D list, each attribute is an element.
   c. each label corresponds to 1D list, and so instances with attributes are 2D matrix, which correspond to label list.
2. a. what is categorical data? -A decision tree can directly learned by categorical data
   b. Machine learning needs input and output numeric
   c. Two methods to encode categorical data: integer encoding and one-hot encoding
      Integer encoding: label encoding. have ordered relationship
      One-hot encoding: no ordinal relationship. binary variable is added for unique integer.
3. a.
