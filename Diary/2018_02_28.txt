Aim:
1. learn cross-validation and model saving.
	Questions: 1. how to achieve cross-validation manually.
			   2. how to automatically change model parameter and save accuracy.
2. train different model and use cross-validation to get accuracy.
3. reorganize to get efficient functions without changing a lot.
4. figure out how to build accuracy output for convenient analysing.


Outcome:
1. The program is divided by user-interface and builder-interface
	For user: only input sequence, and get result.
			  File: 1. get input query
			  		2. transform it into sliding window and onehotencoding.
			  		3. load model and predict
			  		4. get results(numerical) and results is transformed into topology information and write the file.
	For builder: get best accuracy model and save it.
				 File:  1. seperate traning set and testing set
				 		2. get right format of training set and testing set
				 		3. input into our model
				 		4. cross validation to get better results
				 		
2. For cross validation, we use same training set and testing set each time to evaluate model accurately.

3. complish how to manually split training and testing set
