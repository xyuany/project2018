Aim:
1. finish training pssm_model and get best result.
2. ***build final model for single sequences, and save it in /logs/model.
	hint: change code and parameter in PreStru.py
   ***build final model for multiple sequences, and save it in /logs/model.
   hint: change code and parameter in pssm.py
3. finish building RandomForest and DesitionMaking tree of single sequence and Save result in /output/CV/
	****hint: change window_size, writehandle and load(i) function
4. write a script for scoring 50 other protein
	****hint: must finish final model of single sequence and multiple sequences before, just load the best model
5. write input for pssm.
	****hint: input format must be single sequence pssm format, load_model, reverse_encoding.



Outcome:
1.  a. split the input.txt and get psi-blast result of input.
	b. get result of input and write input_pssm.py for pssm.
