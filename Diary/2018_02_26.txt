Idea:
1. cas1.3lines have 513 lines and 171 proteins.
2. there are 1 same protein, just ignore them.
3. finish the input data structure:
	each id is key of dictionary:
	each topology and sequences can merge into a list
	each value of key is the list
	benifits: 1. avoid repete sequence.
			  2. two lines can correspond to each other.
	
	Questions: 
		1. how to make a[key] = [value1, value2]
4. different encode and sliding window.
	a. if we encode AA sequence into number first = n , when sliding windows applied, it will be repeated when binary import.
	b. if we first apply sliding window, then encode into numbers will repeat and encode binary will repeat again.
	c. encode into number then into binary, no repete, but diffcult when choose sliding window.
	
	select a option
	
	
	

Aim: 
	1. try to get unique aa(maybe not 20)
	2. how to encode in number, like amino acid E->14, when window size 3, AEE->[1,14,14]
	
Outcome: 
	1. solve return two values/dictionaries.
		seq dictionary and topo dictionary.
	2. solve unique aa and topo
	3. one hot encode.
		input: array. 
		output: It can convert [1,14,14] into a 3*20 array ->[1,0,0,0,0,.......1,0,0,0,0]
