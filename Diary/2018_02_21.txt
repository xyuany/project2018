Idea:
1. pro seq->input->SVM->output->topology. 
2. SVM is machine learning method only works on mathematics and number. SVM input prefer 	 b. 2D array = number of sample * features
	c. protein 2nd structure is more complex. So we use SLIDING/FLANKING window.
	d. one sample want to train is one silding window.
	e. first and last animo acid will be lost when setting sliding window. We can just add place-holder like 0 animo acid
	f. if window size is 5, then input feature list is 5*20 = 100. 
3. We should encode protein seq and topology with number.
4. sklearn python is machine learning package. 
5. numpy and scipy can deal with number.
6. check "machine leatrning" lab, it has encoded amino acid into number. We can find some ideas in it.
7. We can have 20 digit binary seq to represent one amino acid.
   "onehotencoder" can do it automatically. 
   

Aim: 
1. find 5 paper (morning)
2. read machine learning introduction.(afternoon)
