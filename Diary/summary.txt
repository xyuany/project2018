1. sliding window is important for prediction of 2nd structure, modify the dataset to get more feature
2. cross validation: calculate accuracy then whole modle and accuracy.
3. use matrix: Matthews correlation coeffient.
4. manage your own dataset, learn the input of sklearn and svm.
5. copy your dataset in 5 proteins to run test.
