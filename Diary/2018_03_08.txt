Aim:
1. try to run all the optimzing steps automatically in one script.
2. the key point is use a list (maybe), and iterate in the list to optimize the model.
3. Read document of each model(SVM,RF,)


Idea:
1. for my code:
	a. loop the window size
		b. loop the SVM, RF,DMT etc..
			c. cross validation.
2. write the CV scores in different files, like:
	a. SVM: win_size	kernel1	kernel2	kernel3 
			5			54.5	52.4	55.6
	b. RF: 
	c. DMK:
3.optimize my cross-validation code to achieve formal items.
4.use 12line_test.txt to test the parameter loop.

Outcome: 
1. integrate the cross-validation function to be easily called when using different model.
2. For SVM, I want to evaluate different window size, C value = [0.01, 1, 100], different kernal = ['linear','poly','rbg','sigmoid']
   with cache_size = 3000
3. For RFC, I want to evaluate different window size, n_estimators = [10,20,30,40,50], min_samples_split =[2,4,6]
4. For DMT, I want to evaluate different window size, max_features = ["auto", None], min_samples_split = [2,4,6]
