Aim:
1. figure out how to run psi-blast and get result.
	a. if I want to run psi-blast, I should know the input command and parameter used.
	b. whether psi-blast can run a file containing several sequences, and outputs are seperated files?

Outcome:
1. psi-blast cannot run and get seperated sequence, so I must split input file.
2. write code to split psi-blast input sequences(one file) into one sequence one file.
3. try to run psi-blast with one sequnce file, and try the parameter.
4. write bash code to run psi-blast iterately.
